    <p><b>H</b>ome offices are set up by people who work from home, whether they are self-employed or telecommute. A home
        office may also describe the headquarters of a large company.As more people elect and are permitted by their
        employers to work from home, home offices have become a part of our everyday lives. Some may be self-employed,
        while others may work with a company that allows them to do their job without commuting to the office. </p>
    <p><b>W</b>ith the internet and other available resources, working from home as a self-employed or a small business owner
        is much more affordable and a more viable option. For example, a caterer may choose to set up shop in her own
        home, rather than pay to rent a traditional office and other related equipment. They may have a separate office
        area in their home where they keep files, client records, and any other information related to her business.</p>
